This development could pave the way for practical quantum systems capable of outperforming classical computers on complex problems. The team used a novel material that stabilizes qubit states longer than previously possible, allowing for deeper computation cycles without data corruption.

Experts are hailing this breakthrough as a step closer to realizing scalable, reliable quantum computing. The findings were published in Nature Physics, with experiments conducted over a span of 18 months. Government agencies and private tech firms are already expressing interest in collaborating to explore the commercial potential of this innovation.', '2025-05-21 09:00:00', 'Dr. Susan Park', 'Science'),
